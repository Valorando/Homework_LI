    <h1>Vehicle</h1>
        <p>
            A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[1]</sup></a>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams),
            watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

        <p>
            Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
